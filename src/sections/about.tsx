                            Hello üëã, I'm Jiaxin (Jacey) Cui.
                            <span className="whitespace-nowrap"> </span>
                            I'm a full-stack developer from Dalian, China.
                            Now I live in the United States.
                            I graduated from Duke University with a Master of Engineering degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializing in Software Engineering.
                            Prior to this, I earned my undergraduate degree from Dalian University of Technology, majoring in Management Information Systems.

                        <p>
                            This is my fifth year studying programming and computer science üë©üèª‚Äçüíª.
                            I have always been passionate about hands-on software engineering,
                            implementing my own ideas, and creating applications that can improve
                            or assist human lives. At the same time,
                            I thoroughly enjoy collaborating and supporting each other in a team,
                            discussing more elegant code architectures and design patterns.
                            This has always been something I love!

                        </p>

                    <MotionDiv delayOffset={0.6}>
                        <p>

                            Outside of programming, my hobbies include music and studying foreign languages and linguistics üìö.
                            I am an amateur pianist üéπ. Recently, I have been learning music theory and improvisational accompaniment,
                            and I hope to one day rearrange some of my favorite songs and do some creative composition.
                            I speak some Japanese (daily conversation level).
                            My dream is to someday combine all these things I love into some really cool work!
